# Ender 2 Pro v4.2.7 Motherboard Conversion.
Converting an Ender 2 Pro to use a Creality v4.2.7 Motherboard. This does require the purchase of a cable adapter set from TH3dStudio.com and a Creality v4.2.7 Motherboard.

## Machine and Wiring Safety: All screw terminal wiring connections should have the tinned ends snipped off and replaced with wire ferrules. You can purchase a wire ferrule and cripping tool kit at the links below. This is the kit I used, and the wire strippers. If you are not sure how to use the kit, see video link below.

# Instructions:
1. Raise X Axis gantry all the way to top of the Z Axis. (This will make it easier to access the bottom of the machine.)
2. Power off the machine and unplug Ender 2 Pro, and remove power cable. Set it aside for now.
3. Tip the machine onto it's right side, with the X Gantry holding up the back end of the machine. This makes it easier to work on. Use a filament box with filament in it under the machine end. This will help balance the machine and raise the machine end up so it makes it easier to get at the screws.
4. Remove the two front rubber feet. (There are two screws hidden under them)
5. Remove the 8 screws and set them aside. (Have a bowl or magnetic dish handy to hold screws and loose parts)
6. Take a picture of the old wiring placements. You can use this as a reference for reassembly. You can also use the v4.2.7 Wiring Layout PDF file for reference when reattaching all of the connecters and plugs.
