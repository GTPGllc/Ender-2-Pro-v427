# Instructions:
1. Raise X Axis gantry all the way to top of the Z Axis. (This will make it easier to access the bottom of the machine.)
2. Unplug Ender 2 Pro, and remove power cable.
3. Tip the machine onto the right side of the machine with the X Gantry holding up the back end of the machine.
4. Remove the two front rubber feet. (There are two screws hidden under them)
5. Remove the 8 screws and set them aside. (Have a bowl or magnetic dish handy to hold screws and loose parts)
6. Take a picture of the old wiring placements. You can use this as a reference for reassembly. You can also use the v4.2.7 Wiring Layout PDF file for reference when reattaching all of the connecters and plugs.
