# Instructions:
1. Raise X Axis gantry all the way to top of the Z Axis. (This will make it easier to access the bottom of the machine.)
2. Power off the machine and unplug Ender 2 Pro, and remove power cable. Set it aside for now.
3. Tip the machine onto it's right side, with the X Gantry holding up the back end of the machine. This makes it easier to work on.
4. Remove the two front rubber feet. (There are two screws hidden under them)
5. Remove the 8 screws and set them aside. (Have a bowl or magnetic dish handy to hold screws and loose parts)
6. Take a picture of the old wiring placements. You can use this as a reference for reassembly. You can also use the v4.2.7 Wiring Layout PDF file for reference when reattaching all of the connecters and plugs.
